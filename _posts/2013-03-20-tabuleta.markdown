description: <b>TaBuLeTa</b> is an open-source Eclipse plug-in to feature location available at <a href="https://github.com/alcemirsantos/tabuleta">GitHub</a>. It is based on testing to support the manual extraction of Software Product Lines. I developed the tool as an extension of the ConcernMapper Eclipse plug-in using recovered information from EclEmma.
