description:  <i>FERRARE</i> is a tool that automates the generation of stress and performance test cases from functional test cases. In this sense, the <b>GENESIS</b> module extends the tool with the ability of replication of existing data in the database to support the execution of the generated stress and performance tests. <i>FERRARE</i> was then renamed <b>FERRARE GT</b>. FERRARE GT is available at <a href="https://github.com/alcemirsantos/ferraregt">GitHub</a>
